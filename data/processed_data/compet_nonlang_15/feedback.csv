DBPYotG84twbs28cA,yes,no,stronglyDisagree,"sort of but not really. You are trying to maximize your bonus by picking the flower that no one else is. In my group, Laju ALWAYS picked the most valuable flower and Minu usually picked a lower value one. I feel like I kind of got stuck picking an option that wasn't great. I also think that Laju ended up with over a $1 more than Minu and I. You get punished for intentionally picking a worse option while allowing someone else to always pick the best. It seems kind of unfair. I feel like if I was the one to pick the highest profit item for the very first few rounds, I would have communicated to everyone else that I would always pick that one and everyone else should pick something else. Instead I started with a mid tier profit flower and that's basically what I was stuck with for the rest of the game",No. This was a really interesting study. I don't think I've ever participated in one like it before.,"Yes, more than enough time. We usually made our decisions in under 20 seconds"

oohs6BwF7DckyHYRj,yes,no,agree,Yes but I did expect the task to be longer. I thought the game would go on for another 10 minutes or so.,The game finished a lot sooner than I expected. I enjoyed the game but thought there might be more rounds than there were. It finished very quickly.,Yes a lot of time considering there are only 6 flowers and the flower options don't change. Luckily the other contestants (or computers) always answered quickly so we didn't wait too long.
