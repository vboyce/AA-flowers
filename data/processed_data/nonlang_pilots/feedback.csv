YRXAcJsKMD4NrXF4h,yes,no,neutral,I guess I would say that the pay was fair based on the instructions we were given,My screen did not load for one of the games and I had to reload the page. I wasn't sure that it would even reload and was worried I was kicked out of the study. I also don't think it is great to tell participants that the first people to complete the instructions and quiz will be accepted into the study because people are then more likely to rush through the instructions.,"No, I felt that the rounds went rather quickly and was not prepared for them to be so fast."
