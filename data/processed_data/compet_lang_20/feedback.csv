bTXd6LwgaNHkP66co,yes,yes,agree,Pay was fair but I felt like the bonus wasn't because I played the most selfless game but got the smallest bonus,yes,It was very frustrating for me because it felt like my counterparts only cared about getting the most expensive flower.

Y7pBdCPT2BT3bjwuZ,yes,no,stronglyDisagree,"No. This was a complete waste of my time. I didn't get the chance to play even one round, just got a message saying someone else had pulled out so I was being kicked out. Very rude.",Who knows? I wasn't given the opportunity to use it at all.,The instructions were a bit confusing but I studied them well and was looking forward to participating in the game. Then I was the denied the opportunity. If the objective of the study was to make me angry you succeeded. Otherwise you failed.,No - I think the one round I was allowed to start was abruptly terminated after about 10 seconds
